## üòé Who is a Fit for Our R&D Team?

1. **Communicative.**
As a startup, we are moving at a fast pace and thus discussions happen oftentimes. You have to be capable of making your points crystal clear as always no matter what kinds of manners you prefer.
2. **Independent.**
Excessive management and paperwork could probably be hurdles on our highway. Hence, we are looking for those who can think, manage and work independently so as to keep clear of unnecessary rules and reviews.
3. **Self-improving.**
We anticipate everyone on the team improves by leaps and bounds in any aspect as the company grows. You have to know what are your strengths and weaknesses, learn how to learn, and go get it. Always polish your soft and hard skills during the journey along with us.

## üö¶ Dos and Dont's for the Interview
1. **DO have mock interviews.**
Want to ace interviews? Survey and go practice. Thanks to the Internet, a plethora of interview tips are out there. Take some notes and find someone to get you a mock interview which definitely benefits you more than you can imagine.
2. **DO think before answering.**
As soon as you receive a question in the interview, please always think before you give any answers. You may ask some clarifying questions (see below), collect your thoughts, and put your answers in an organized way. No one would be pleased if your answers are just bad and confusing montages.
3. **DO ask clarifying questions before jumping into details.** 
Theoretically, you do not have experience working with the interviewers, and many of terms and concepts were shaped in distinct ways. So, you and, of course, the interviewers, are supposed to make some efforts to ask clarifying questions to be in sync and narrow down the question scope if necessary. This is one of the keys to effective conversation.
4. **DON'T be nervous.**
Being on edge is a good way to fall down. Try to relax before the interview, and be confident and comfortable during the interview.
5. **DON'T brag or lie.**
Trust and reliability are essential to smooth teamwork. Neither a bragger nor a liar is the partner we are searching for.
