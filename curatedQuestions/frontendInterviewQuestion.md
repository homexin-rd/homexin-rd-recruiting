A couple of interview questions are presented below. It is worth mentioning that they are nothing more than starting points and you may expect that several follow-up questions would be asked.

<br/>

## ðŸ’» Technical Questions

* Could you offer your insights into React Component and React Function? Which do you favor and why?

* Please draw a diagram and describe how the component lifecycle works in the React world.

* Hooks (e.g., useState) play a great role in the React world. Please describe some of them and how these Hooks work.

* Tell us anything you know about the JavaScript prototype chain (prototype inheritance). You may draw a diagram if you need to.

* Do you think there are some glitches in JavaScript according to the experience of your own? And how did you resolve the issue?

* What is the major difference between JavaScript and TypeScript? What are the pros and cons when one is converting the codebase from JavaScript to TypeScript?

## ðŸ‘¤ Behavioral Questions

* Imagine you are a key individual contributor at a tech company. For some reason and subsequent to a couple of heated discussions, you have to be in charge of converting a frontend web from CSR to SSR. Unfortunately, you barely know SSR. Then, how would you pick up this required technique?

* Every single developer grows their habits, senses, and principles, ranging from coding styles, and development workflows, to system design preferences. Here, we want to know more about you. Could you share some of the principles you've stuck to or any good habits that you advocate?

* Tech world is ever-changing. How do you keep your tech skills and knowledge current?
